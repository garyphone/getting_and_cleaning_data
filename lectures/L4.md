# Week 4

## Editing Text Variables

**Fixing character vectors - tolower(), toupper()**

```
tolower(names(cameraData))
```

**Fixing character vectors - strsplit()**

* Good for automatically splitting variable names

* Important parameters: x, split

```
splitNames = strsplit(names(cameraData), "\\,")
splitNames[[5]]
```

**Quick aside - lists**

```
mylist <- list(letters = c("A", "b", "c"), numbers = 1:3, matrix(1:25, ncol = 5))
head(mylist)
```

**Fixing character vectors - sapply()**

* Applies a function to each element in a vector or list

* Important parameters: X, FUN

```
firstElement <- function(x){x[1]}
sapply(splitNames, firstElement)
```

**Important points about text in data sets**

* Names of variables should be

	* All lower case when possible
	
	* Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx)
	
	* Not duplicated
	
	* Not have underscores or dots or white spaces
	
* Variables with character values

	* Should usually be made into factor variables (depends on application)
	
	* Should be descriptive (use TRUE/FALSE instand of 1/0 and Male/Female versus 1/0 or M/F)

## Regular Expressions I

**Regular expressions**

* Regular expressions can be thought of as a combination of literals and *metacharacters*

* To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text forming the words of this language, and 
the metacharacters defining its grammar

* Regular expressions have a rich set of metacharacters

* Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the 
text being tested

We need a way to expressions

* whitespace word boundaries

* set of literals

* the beginning and end of a line

* alternatives ("war" or "peace") Metacharacters to the rescue!
