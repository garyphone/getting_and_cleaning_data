# Week 4

## Editing Text Variables

**Fixing character vectors - tolower(), toupper()**

```
tolower(names(cameraData))
```

**Fixing character vectors - strsplit()**

* Good for automatically splitting variable names

* Important parameters: x, split

```
splitNames = strsplit(names(cameraData), "\\,")
splitNames[[5]]
```

**Quick aside - lists**

```
mylist <- list(letters = c("A", "b", "c"), numbers = 1:3, matrix(1:25, ncol = 5))
head(mylist)
```

**Fixing character vectors - sapply()**

* Applies a function to each element in a vector or list

* Important parameters: X, FUN

```
firstElement <- function(x){x[1]}
sapply(splitNames, firstElement)
```

**Important points about text in data sets**

* Names of variables should be

	* All lower case when possible
	
	* Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx)
	
	* Not duplicated
	
	* Not have underscores or dots or white spaces
	
* Variables with character values

	* Should usually be made into factor variables (depends on application)
	
	* Should be descriptive (use TRUE/FALSE instand of 1/0 and Male/Female versus 1/0 or M/F)

## Regular Expressions I

**Regular expressions**

* Regular expressions can be thought of as a combination of literals and *metacharacters*

* To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text forming the words of this language, and 
the metacharacters defining its grammar

* Regular expressions have a rich set of metacharacters

* Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the 
text being tested

We need a way to expressions

* whitespace word boundaries

* set of literals

* the beginning and end of a line

* alternatives ("war" or "peace") Metacharacters to the rescue!

## Regular Expressions II

**More Metacharacters: |**

This does not mean "pipe" in the context of regular expressions, instead it translates to "or".
We can use it to combine two expressions, the subexpressions being called alternatives

**More Metacharacters: ?**

The question mark indicates that the indicated expression is optional

**One thing to note...**

In the following

```
[Gg]eorge( [Ww]\.)? [Bb]ush
```

we wanted to match a "." as a literal period; to do that, we had to "escape" the metacharacter, preceding it
with a backslash. In general, we have to do this for any metacharacter we want to include in our match.

**More metacharacters: * and +**

The * and + signs are metacharacters used to indicate repetition; * means "any number, including none, of the item"
and + means "at least one of the item"

**More metacharacters: { and }**

{ and } are referred to as interval quantifiers; then let us specify the minimum and maximum number of matches of an 
expression

**More metacharacters: ( and ) revisited**

* In most implementations of regular expressions, the parentheses not only limit the scope of alternatives divided by a 
"|", but also can be used to "remember" text matched by the subexpression enclosed

* We refer to the matched text with \1, \2, etc.

**Summary**

* Regular expressions are used in many different languages; not unique to R

* Regular expressions are composed of literals and metacharacters that represent sets or 
classes of characters/words

* Text processing via regular expressions is a very powerful way to extract data from "unfriendly"
sources (not all data comes as a CSV file)

* Used with the functions `grep, grepl, sub, gsub` and others that involve searching for text strings
