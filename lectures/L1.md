# Week 1

## Raw and Processed Data

**Raw versus processed data**

Raw data

* The original source of the data

* Often hard to use for data analyses

* Data analysis includes processing

* Raw data may only need to be processed once

Processed data

* Data that is ready for analysis

* Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc.

* There may be standards for processing

## Components of Tidy Data

**The four things you should have**

1. The raw data

2. A tidy data set

3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set

4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2, 3.

**The raw data**

* The strange binary file your measurement machine spits out

* The unformatted Excel file with 10 worksheets the company you contracted with sent you

* The complicated JSON data you got from scraping the Twitter API

* The hand-entered numbers you collected looking through a microscope

You know the raw data is in the right format if you

1. Ran no software on the data

2. Did not manipulate any of the numbers in the data

3. You did not remove any data from the data set

**The tidy data**

1. Each variable you measure should be in one column

2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row

3. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable

4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked

Some other important tips

* Include a row at the top of each file with variable names

* Make variable names human readable

* In general data should be saved in one file per table

**The code book**

1. Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data

2. Information about the summary choices you made

3. Information about the experimental study design you used

Some other important tips

* A common format for this document is a Word/text file

* There should be a section called "Study design" that has a thorough description of how you collected the data

* There must be a section called "Code book" that describes each variable and its units

**The instruction list**

* Ideally a computer script (in R)

* The input for the script is the raw data

* The output is the processed, tidy data

* There are no paramenters to the script

In some cases it will not be possible to script every step. In that case you should provide instruction like:

1. Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with paramenters a=1, b=2, c=3

2. Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample

3. Step 3 - take column three of output file, out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data
set

## Downloading Files

**Get/set your working directory**

* A basic component of working with data is knowing your working directory

* The two main commands are `getwd()` and `setwd()`

* Be aware of relative versus absolute paths. Relative: `setwd("./data")`, `setwd("../")`. Absolute: `setwd(/Users/jtleek/data/)`

* Important difference in Windows `setwd("C:\\Users\\Andrew\\Downloads")`

**Checking for and creating directories**

* `file.exists("directoryName")` will check to see if the directory exists

* `dir.create("directoryName")` will create a directory if it does not exist

* Here is an example checking for a "data" directory and creating it if it does not exist

```
if (!file.exists("data")) {
	dir.create("data")
}
```

**Getting data from the internet - download.file()**

* Downloads a file from the internet

* Even if you could do this by hand, helps with reproducibility

* Important paramenters are url, destfile, method

* Useful for downloading tab-delimited, csv, and other files

**Some notes about download.file()**

* If the url starts with http you can use download.file()

* If the url starts with https on Windows you may be ok

* If the url starts with https on Mac you may need to set method="curl"

* If the file is big, this might take a while

* Be sure to record when you downloaded

## Reading Local Files

**Downloading the file to load**

```
if (!file.exists("data")) {
	dir.create("data")
}
fileUrl <- "https://data.abcd.gov/api"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "xxx.csv", method = "curl")
dateDownloaded <- date()
```

**Loading flat files - read.table()**

* This is the main function for reading data into Ran

* Flexible and robust but requires more parameters

* Reads the data into RAM - big data can cause problems

* Important parameters *file*, *header*, *sep*, *row.names*, *nrows*

* Related: *read.csv()*, *read.csv2()*

**Example**

```
cameraData <- read.table("./data/cameras.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
head(cameraData)
```

read.csv sets *sep = ","*, and *header = TRUE*

```
cameraData <- read.csv("./data/cameras.csv")
head(cameraData)
```

**Some more important paramenters**

* *quote* - you can tell R whether there are any quoted values quote = "" means no quotes

* *na.strings* - set the character that represents a missing values

* *nrows* - how many rows to read of the file (e.g. nrows = 10 reads 10 lines)

* *skip* - number of lines to skip before starting to read

*In my experience, the biggest trouble with reading flat files are quotation marks ` or " places in data values,
setting quote = "" often resolves these.*
