# Question 1
#
# The American Community Survey distributes downloadable data about United States 
# communities. Download the 2006 microdata survey about housing for the state of Idaho 
# using download.file() from here: 
#
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06hid.csv 
#
# and load the data into R. The code book, describing the variable names is here: 
#
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FPUMSDataDict06.pdf
#
# Create a logical vector that identifies the households on greater than 10 acres 
# who sold more than $10,000 worth of agriculture products. Assign that logical vector 
# to the variable agricultureLogical. Apply the which() function like this to identify 
# the rows of the data frame where the logical vector is TRUE. which(agricultureLogical) 
#
# What are the first 3 values in that result?

# Question 2
#
# Using the jpeg package read in the following picture of your instructor into R
#
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fjeff.jpg
#
# Use the parameter native=TRUE. What are the 30th and 80th quantiles of the resulting 
# data? (some Linux systems may produce an answer 638 different for the 30th quantile)

# Question 3
# 
# Load the Gross Domestic Product data for the 190 ranked countries in this data set:
