# Question 1
#
# Register an application with the Github API here: 
# https://github.com/settings/applications. 
#
# Access the API to get information on your instructors repositories 
# (hint: this is the url you want "https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos"). 
# Use this data to find the time that the datasharing repo was created. 
#
# What time was it created? 
#
# Hints:
# This tutorial may be useful
# https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/demo/oauth2-github.r
#
# You may also need to run the code in the base R package and not R studio.

# Find OAuth settings for github:
# http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/
github <- oauth_endpoints("github")

# Replace your key and secret below.
myapp <- oauth_app("github",
                   key = "319cffb9580b74b3e3fc",

# Get OAuth credentials
github_token <- oauth2.0_token(github, myapp)

# Use the API
gtoken <- config(token = github_token)

# Question 2
#
# The sqldf package allows for execution of SQL commands on R data frames. 
# We will use the sqldf package to practice the queries we might send with the dbSendQuery command in RMySQL. 
# Download the American Community Survey data and load it into an R object called 'acs':
#
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06pid.csv 
# 
# Which of the following commands will select only the data for the probability weights 
# pwgtp1 with ages less than 50?
#
# 1. sqldf("select pwgtp1 from acs where AGEP < 50")
# 2. sqldf("select * from acs")
# 3. sqldf("select pwgtp1 from acs")
# 4. sqldf("select * from acs where AGEP < 50 and pwgtp1")

msg("Probability weights for people with ages less than 50:")
msg("sqldf('select pwgtp1 from acs where AGEP < 50'):", head(answer2))

# Question 3
#
# Using the same data frame you created in the previous problem, what is the equivalent 
# function to unique(acs$AGEP)
#
# 1. sqldf("select distinct pwgtp1 from acs")
# 2. sqldf("select unique * from acs")
# 3. sqldf("select distinct AGEP from acs")
# 4. sqldf("select AGEP where unique from acs")

# Question 4
#
# How many characters are in the 10th, 20th, 30th and 100th lines of HTML from this page:
#
# http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/contact.html
#
# (Hint: the nchar() function in R may be helpful)

# Question 5
#
# Read this data set into R and report the sum of the numbers in the fourth column.
#
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fwksst8110.for
