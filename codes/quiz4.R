# Question 1
#
# The American Community Survey distributes downloadable data about United States communities. 
# Download the 2006 microdata survey about housing for the state of Idaho using download.file() from here: 
#  
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06hid.csv 
#
# and load the data into R. The code book, describing the variable names is here: 
#  
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FPUMSDataDict06.pdf 
#
# Apply strsplit() to split all the names of the data frame on the characters "wgtp". 
#
# What is the value of the 123 element of the resulting list?

# Question 2

# Question 3
#
# In the data set from Question 2 what is a regular expression that would allow you to count the number of countries whose name begins with "United"?

# How many countries begin with United?

# Question 5
#
# You can use the quantmod (http://www.quantmod.com/) package to get historical stock prices for publicly traded companies on the NASDAQ and NYSE. 
# Use the following code to download data on Amazon's stock price and get the times the data was sampled.
